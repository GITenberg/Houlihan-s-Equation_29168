<p class="pr1"><b><big>The tiny spaceship had been built for a journey to a star. But its
small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny&mdash;on Earth.</big></b></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">I&nbsp;must</span> admit that at first I
wasn't sure I was hearing those
noises. It was in a park near the
nuclear propulsion center&mdash;a cool,
green spot, with the leaves all telling
each other to hush, be quiet,
and the soft breeze stirring them up
again. I had known precisely such
a secluded little green sanctuary just
over the hill from Mr. Riordan's
farm when I was a boy.</p>

<p>Now it was a place I came to
when I had a problem to thrash out.
That morning I had been trying to
work out an equation to give the
coefficient of discharge for the matter
in combustion. You may call it
gas, if you wish, for we treated it
like gas at the center for convenience&mdash;as
it came from the rocket
tubes in our engine.</p>

<p>Without this coefficient to give
us control, we would have lacked a
workable equation when we set
about putting the first moon rocket
around those extraordinary engines
of ours, which were still in the undeveloped
blueprint stage.</p>

<p>I see I shall have to explain this,
although I had hoped to get right
along with my story. When you
start from scratch, matter discharged
from any orifice has a velocity directly
proportional to the square
root of the pressure-head driving it.
But when you actually put things
together, contractions or expansions
in the gas, surface roughness
and other factors make the velocity
a bit smaller.</p>

<p>At the terrible discharge speed
of nuclear explosion&mdash;which is
what the drive amounts to despite
the fact that it is simply water in
which nuclear salts have been previously
dissolved&mdash;this small factor
makes quite a difference. I had
to figure everything into it&mdash;diameter
of the nozzle, sharpness of the
edge, the velocity of approach to the
point of discharge, atomic weight
and structure&mdash; Oh, there is so
much of this that if you're not a
nuclear engineer yourself it's certain
to weary you.</p>

<p>Perhaps you had better take my
word for it that without this equation&mdash;correctly
stated, mind you&mdash;mankind
would be well advised not
to make a first trip to the moon.
And all this talk of coefficients and
equations sits strangely, you might
say, upon the tongue of a man
named Kevin Francis Houlihan.
But I am, after all, a scientist. If I
had not been a specialist in my field
I would hardly have found myself
engaged in vital research at the
center.</p>

<p>Anyway, I heard these little
noises in the park. They sounded
like small working sounds, blending
in eerily mysterious fashion with a
chorus of small voices. I thought at
first it might be children at play,
but then at the time I was a bit
absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge
of the trees, not wanting to deprive
any small scalawags of their pleasure,
and peered out between the
branches. And what do you suppose
I saw? Not children, but a
group of little people, hard at work.</p>

<p>There was a leader, an older one
with a crank face. He was beating
the air with his arms and piping:
"Over here, now! All right, bring
those electrical connections over
here&mdash;and see you're not slow as
treacle about it!"</p>

<p>There were perhaps fifty of the
little people. I was more than startled
by it, too. I had not seen little
people in&mdash;oh, close to thirty years.
I had seen them first as a boy of
eight, and then, very briefly again,
on my tenth birthday. And I had
become convinced they could <i>never</i>
be seen here in America. I had
never seen them so busy, either.
They were building something in
the middle of the glade. It was long
and shiny and upright and a little
over five feet in height.</p>

<p>"Come along now, people!" said
this crotchety one, looking straight
at me. "Stop starin' and get to
work! You'll not be needin' to
mind that man standin' there! You
know he can't see nor hear us!"</p>

<p>Oh, it was good to hear the rich
old tongue again. I smiled, and the
foreman of the leprechauns&mdash;if
that's what he was&mdash;saw me smile
and became stiff and alert for a moment,
as though suspecting that perhaps
I actually could see him. Then
he shrugged and turned away, clearly
deeming such a thing impossible.</p>

<p>I said, "Just a minute, friend,
and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens
I <i>can</i> see you."</p>

<p>He whirled to face me again,
staring open-mouthed. Then he
said, "What? What's that, now?"</p>

<p>"I can see you," I said.</p>

<p>"Ohhh!" he said and put his
palms to his cheekbones. "Saints be
with us! He's a believer! Run everybody&mdash;run
for your lives!"</p>

<p>And they all began running, in
as many directions as there were
little souls. They began to scurry
behind the trees and bushes, and a
sloping embankment nearby.</p>

<p>"No, wait!" I said. "Don't go
away! I'll not be hurting you!"</p>

<p>They continued to scurry.</p>

<p>I knew what it was they feared.
"I don't intend catching one of
you!" I said. "Come back, you daft
little creatures!"</p>

<p>But the glade was silent, and they
had all disappeared. They thought I
wanted their crock of gold, of
course. I'd be entitled to it if I could
catch one and keep him. Or so the
legends affirmed, though I've wondered
often about the truth of them.
But I was after no gold. I only wanted
to hear the music of an Irish
tongue. I was lonely here in America,
even if I had latched on to a fine
job of work for almost shamefully
generous pay. You see, in a place as
full of science as the nuclear propulsion
center there is not much
time for the old things. I very much
wanted to talk to the little people.</p>

<p>I walked over to the center of
the glade where the curious shiny
object was standing. It was as
smooth as glass and shaped like a
huge cigar. There were a pair of
triangular fins down at the bottom,
and stubby wings amidships. Of
course it was a spaceship, or a
miniature replica of one. I looked
at it more closely. Everything seemed
almost miraculously complete
and workable.</p>

<p>I shook my head in wonder, then
stepped back from the spaceship
and looked about the glade. I knew
they were all hiding nearby, watching
me apprehensively. I lifted my
head to them.</p>

<p>"Listen to me now, little people!"
I called out. "My name's
Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.
I am descended from King
Niall himself&mdash;or so at least my
father used to say! Come on out
now, and pass the time o' day!"</p>

<p>Then I waited, but they didn't
answer. The little people always
had been shy. Yet without reaching
a decision in so many words I knew
suddenly that I <i>had</i> to talk to them.
I'd come to the glen to work out a
knotty problem, and I was up
against a blank wall. Simply because
I was so lonely that my mind had
become clogged.</p>

<p>I knew that if I could just once
hear the old tongue again, and talk
about the old things, I might be able
to think the problem through to a
satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>So I stepped back to the tiny
spaceship, and this time I struck it
a resounding blow with my fist.
"Hear me now, little people! If you
don't show yourselves and come out
and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship
from stem to stern!"</p>

<hr />

<p>I heard only the leaves rustling
softly.</p>

<p>"Do you understand? I'll give
you until I count three to make an
appearance! One!"</p>

<p>The glade remained deathly silent.</p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,
as if a small, brittle twig had
snapped in the underbrush.</p>

<p>"<i>Three!</i>"</p>

<p>And with that the little people
suddenly appeared.</p>

<p>The leader&mdash;he seemed more
wizened and bent than before&mdash;approached
me slowly and warily as I
stood there. The others all followed
at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure
them and then waved my arm
in a friendly gesture of greeting.</p>

<p>"Good morning," I said.</p>

<p>"Good morning," the foreman
said with some caution. "My name
is Keech."</p>

<p>"And mine's Houlihan, as I've
told you. Are you convinced now
that I have no intention of doing
you any injury?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Houlihan," said Keech,
drawing a kind of peppered dignity
up about himself, "in such matters
I am never fully convinced. After
living for many centuries I am all
too acutely aware of the perversity
of human nature."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Well, as you will
quickly see, all I want to do is
talk." I nodded as I spoke, and sat
down cross-legged upon the grass.</p>

<p>"Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.
Houlihan."</p>

<p>"And often that's <i>all</i> he wants,"
I said. "Sit down with me now, and
stop staring as if I were a snake
returned to the Island."</p>

<p>He shook his head and remained
standing. "Have your say, Mr.
Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate
it if you'll go away and
leave us to our work."</p>

<p>"Well, now, your work," I said,
and glanced at the spaceship.
"That's exactly what's got me curious."</p>

<p>The others had edged in a bit
now and were standing in a circle,
intently staring at me. I took out my
pipe. "Why," I asked, "would a
group of little people be building a
spaceship here in America&mdash;out in
this lonely place?"</p>

<p>Keech stared back without much
expression, and said, "I've been
wondering how you guessed it was
a spaceship. I was surprised enough
when you told me you could see us
but not overwhelmingly so. I've run
into believers before who could see
the little people. It happens every
so often, though not as frequently
as it did a century ago. But knowing
a spaceship at first glance! Well, I
must confess that <i>does</i> astonish
me."</p>

<p>"And why wouldn't I know a
spaceship when I see one?" I said.
"It just so happens I'm a doctor of
science."</p>

<p>"A doctor of science, now," said
Keech.</p>

<p>"Invited by the American government
to work on the first moon
rocket here at the nuclear propulsion
center. Since it's no secret I
can advise you of it."</p>

<p>"A scientist, is it," said Keech.
"Well, now, that's very interesting."</p>

<p>"I'll make no apologies for it," I
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no need for apology,"
said Keech. "Though in truth
we prefer poets to scientists. But it
has just now crossed my mind, Mr.
Houlihan that you, being a scientist,
might be of help to us."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I might try starting at the
beginning," he replied.</p>

<p>"You might," I said. "A man
usually does."</p>

<p>Keech took out his own pipe&mdash;a
clay dudeen&mdash;and looked hopeful.
I gave him a pinch of tobacco from
my pouch. "Well, now," he said,
"first of all you're no doubt surprised
to find us here in America."</p>

<p>"I am surprised from time to
time to find myself here," I said.
"But continue."</p>

<p>"We had to come here," said
Keech, "to learn how to make a
spaceship."</p>

<p>"A spaceship, now," I said, unconsciously
adopting some of the
old manner.</p>

<p>"Leprechauns are not really mechanically
inclined," said Keech.
"Their major passions are music
and laughter and mischief, as anyone
knows."</p>

<p>"Myself included," I agreed.
"Then why do you need a spaceship?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I may use an old expression,
we've had a feelin' lately
that we're not long for this world.
Or let me put it this way. We feel
the world isn't long for itself."</p>

<p>I scratched my cheek. "How
would a man unravel a statement
such as that?"</p>

<p>"It's very simple. With all the
super weapons you mortals have
developed, there's the distinct possibility
you might be blowin' us all
up in the process of destroying
yourselves."</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> that possibility," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, as I say," said
Keech, "the little people have decided
to leave the planet in a spaceship.
Which we're buildin' here and
now. We've spied upon you and
learned how to do it. Well&mdash;almost
how to do it. We haven't learned
yet how to control the power&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, now," I said. "Leaving
the planet, you say. And where
would you be going?"</p>

<p>"There's another committee
working on that. 'Tis not our concern.
I was inclined to suggest the
constellation Orion, which sounds
as though it has a good Irish name,
but I was hooted down. Be that as it
may, my own job was to go into
your nuclear center, learn how to
make the ship, and proceed with its
construction. Naturally, we didn't
understand all of your high-flyin'
science, but some of our people are
pretty clever at gettin' up replicas
of things."</p>

<p>"You mean you've been spying
on us at the center all this time? Do
you know, we often had the feeling
we were being watched, but we
thought it was by the Russians.
There's one thing which puzzles
me, though. If you've been constantly
around us&mdash;and I'm still
able to see the little people&mdash;why
did I never see you before?"</p>

<p>"It may be we never crossed your
path. It may be you can only see us
when you're thinkin' of us, and of
course truly believin' in us. I don't
know&mdash;'tis a thing of the mind, and
not important at the moment.
What's important is for us to get
our first ship to workin' properly
and then we'll be on our way."</p>

<p>"You're determined to go."</p>

<p>"Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.
Now&mdash;to business. Just during
these last few minutes a certain matter
has crossed my mind. That's
why I'm wastin' all this time with
you, sir. You say you are a scientist."</p>

<p>"A nuclear engineer."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it may be that you
can help us&mdash;now that you know
we're here."</p>

<p>"Help you?"</p>

<p>"The power control, Mr. Houlihan.
As I understand it, 'tis necessary
to know at any instant exactly
how much thrust is bein' delivered
through the little holes in back.
And on paper it looks simple
enough&mdash;the square of somethin' or
other. I've got the figures jotted in
a book when I need 'em. But when
you get to doin' it it doesn't come
out exactly as it does on paper."</p>

<p>"You're referring to the necessity
for a coefficient of discharge."</p>

<p>"Whatever it might be named,"
said Keech, shrugging. "'Tis the
one thing we lack. I suppose eventually
you people will be gettin'
around to it. But meanwhile we
need it right now, if we're to make
our ship move."</p>

<p>"And you want me to help you
with this?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what crossed my
mind."</p>

<p>I nodded and looked grave and
kneaded my chin for a moment softly.
"Well, now, Keech," I said
finally, "why should I help you?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Keech, grinning, but
not with humor, "the avarice of
humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,
I'll give you reason enough.
The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!"</p>

<p>"The one at the end of the rainbow?"</p>

<p>"It's not at the end of the rainbow.
That's a grandmother's tale.
Nor is it actually in an earthen
crock. But there's gold, all right,
enough to make you rich for the
rest of your life. And I'll make you
a proposition."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"We'll not be needin' gold where
we're goin'. It's yours if you show
us how to make our ship work."</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's quite an
offer," I said. Keech had the goodness
to be quiet while I sat and
thought for a while. My pipe had
gone out and I lit it again. I finally
said, "Let's have a look at your
ship's drive and see what we can
see."</p>

<p>"You accept the proposition
then?"</p>

<p>"Let's have a look," I said, and
that was all.</p>

<p>Well, we had a look, and then
several looks, and before the morning
was out we had half the spaceship
apart, and were deep in argument
about the whole project.</p>

<p>It was a most fascinating session.
I had often wished for a true working
model at the center, but no allowance
had been inserted in the
budget for it. Keech brought me
paper and pencil and I talked with
the aid of diagrams, as engineers
are wont to do. Although the pencils
were small and I had to hold
them between thumb and forefinger,
as you would a needle, I was
able to make many sensible observations
and even a few innovations.</p>

<p>I came back again the next day&mdash;and
every day for the following
two weeks. It rained several times,
but Keech and his people made a
canopy of boughs and leaves and I
was comfortable enough. Every once
in a while someone from the town
or the center itself would pass by,
and stop to watch me. But of course
they wouldn't see the leprechauns
or anything the leprechauns had
made, not being believers.</p>

<p>I would halt work, pass the time
of day, and then, in subtle fashion,
send the intruder on his way. Keech
and the little people just stood by
and grinned all the while.</p>

<p>At the end of sixteen days I had
the entire problem all but whipped.
It is not difficult to understand why.
The working model and the fact
that the small people with their
quick eyes and clever fingers could
spot all sorts of minute shortcomings
was a great help. And I was
hearing the old tongue and talking
of the old things every day, and
truly that went far to take the clutter
out of my mind. I was no longer
so lonely that I couldn't think properly.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth day I covered a
piece of paper with tiny mathematical
symbols and handed it to Keech.
"Here is your equation," I said. "It
will enable you to know your thrust
at any given moment, under any
circumstances, in or out of gravity,
and under all conditions of friction
and combustion."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Houlihan," said
Keech. All his people had gathered
in a loose circle, as though attending
a rite. They were all looking at
me quietly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Houlihan," said Keech,
"you will not be forgotten by the
leprechauns. If we ever meet again,
upon another world perchance,
you'll find our friendship always
eager and ready."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Houlihan," said
Keech, "I'll see that a quantity of
gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,
and so keep my part of the
bargain."</p>

<p>"I'll not be needing the gold," I
said.</p>

<p>Keech's eyebrows popped upward.
"What's this now?"</p>

<p>"I'll not be needing it," I repeated.
"I don't feel it would be
right to take it for a service of this
sort."</p>

<p>"Well," said Keech in surprise,
and in some awe, too, "well, now,
musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first
time I ever heard such a speech
from a mortal." He turned to his
people. "We'll have three cheers
now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan&mdash;friend
of the little people as
long as he shall live!"</p>

<p>And they cheered. And little tears
crept into the corners of some of
their turned-up eyes.</p>

<p>We shook hands, all of us, and I
left.</p>

<hr />

<p>I walked through the park, and
back to the nuclear propulsion center.
It was another cool, green morning
with the leaves making only
soft noises as the breezes came
along. It smelled exactly like a
wood I had known in Roscommon.</p>

<p>And I lit my pipe and smoked it
slowly and chuckled to myself at
how I had gotten the best of the
little people. Surely it was not every
mortal who could accomplish that. I
had given them the wrong equation,
of course. They would never get
their spaceship to work now, and
later, if they tried to spy out the
right information I would take special
measures to prevent it, for I had
the advantage of being able to see
them.</p>

<p>As for our own rocket ship, it
should be well on its way by next
St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed
determined the true coefficient of
discharge, which I never could have
done so quickly without those sessions
in the glade with Keech and
his working model.</p>

<p>It would go down in scientific
literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's
Equation, and that was honor
and glory enough for me. I could
do without Keech's pot of gold,
though it would have been pleasant
to be truly rich for a change.</p>

<p>There was no sense in cheating
him out of the gold to boot, for
leprechauns are most clever in matters
of this sort and he would have
had it back soon enough&mdash;or else
made it a burden in some way.</p>

<p>Indeed, I had done a piece of
work greatly to my advantage, and
also to the advantage of humankind,
and when a man can do the first and
include the second as a fortunate byproduct
it is a most happy accident.</p>

<p>For if I had shown the little people
how to make a spaceship they
would have left our world. And
this world, as long as it lasts&mdash;what
would it be in that event? I ask you
now, wouldn't we be even <i>more</i>
likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom
Come without the little people here
for us to believe in every now and
then?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
